        Minecraft is a sandbox construction video game developed by Mojang
        Studios where players interact with a fully modifiable three-dimensional
        environment made of blocks and entities. Its diverse gameplay lets
        players choose the way they play, allowing for countless possibilities.
        There are three actively maintained editions of Minecraft: Java Edition,
        Bedrock Edition, and Education Edition.

      <p>Did you know…</p>
      <p>
        ... that furnace minecarts are fully functional in Java Edition, but
        only exist as an unused texture in Bedrock Edition?
      </p>
      <p>
        ... that in Education Edition and education-enabled Bedrock Edition,
        combining two units of the same chemical compound in a lab table still
        produces failed effects?
      </p>
      <p>
        ... that fishing in Minecraft is slower when the bobber is not directly
        under the sky?
      </p>
      <p>
        ... that climbing up scaffolding costs the same exhaustion level as
        jumping up every block?
